# sign-up-form
A sample form built primarily using HTMl and CSS. The form includes inputs to add items like the user's first name, their email address, and an optional phone number. There is also a JavaScript event listener added to the "Confirm Password" input to display a message if the user's original password and rewritten password are not an exact match.
